# Implementation of K-Means in Python

This project is to implement the K-means algorithm in Python 3. 
The libraries used in the implementation includes:
* numpy
* scipy.spatial

## K_means.py
This module contains the functions to perform K-means on dataset. 

## Demonstration
Uses Ecoil dataset to demonstrate the K_means algorithm in a Jupyter notebook. 
The result obtained is compared with the result obtained using Scikit-learn.
